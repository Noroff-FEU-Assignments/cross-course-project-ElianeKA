    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[I would first look at what kind of client it is. If it is for a small business that just needs a website, but don´t expect much traffic, I would advise them to either use a shared host or a VPS. It depends on how much they want to spend on it, as long as they don´t expect all that much traffic. If the client is a bigger business, I would strongly advise them to use a private host. Since it offers great flexibility and dependability. I would also advise them to use a URL the begins with “https” rather than “http”, the “s” stands for secure, wich indicates the sites are using a secure socket layer. I would honestly advise this to anyone, but I would understand that it would be a bit overkill for the smaller business, if they don´t really have that much sensitive information out there.  I would also advise them on one or more practices. Like; “Secure authorization and authentication” Wich is a two-step process.]</p>
